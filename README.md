Public Repo for Coursera/JHU Data Science Specialization courses

This repository's top-level contains the latest assignment for any of the Coursera/JHU courses I'm taking. If the course assignment asks for a README.md specifically, this file will be temporarirly renamed README-REPO.md.

In addition to this README, it currently contains files related to Exploratory Data Analysis, course project #1. This set includes, as requested by the assignment:
- the four .PNG files representing the plots from the assignment (see https://class.coursera.org/exdata-013/human_grading/view/courses/973507/assessments/3/submissions)
- the four .R files to generate the plots

Please note:
- It does NOT contain the original .txt file for the assignment. The scripts assume the .txt file is available in the local directory.

ALSO: I've noticed sometimes GitHub does not show the PNG file on the first try. If you're having issues seeing the files, please refresh/reopen your browser or download the files and view locally. Thanks! :-)
